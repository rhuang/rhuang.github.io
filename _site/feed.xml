  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-view-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December, I was sent on a business trip to Luxembourg for a month. On the weekends while I was there, I took advantage of Luxembourg’s great central location in Europe and went travelling. As a snowboarder, I am aware of the famous Swiss alps - the great white expanse of powder and breath taking mountain ranges. Research was conducted and I decided that I must go to Zermatt, where the Matterhorn is located. Leaving on Friday night after work from Luxembourg, and getting back to Luxembourg on Monday morning, while fitting in two days of snowboarding at Zermatt, was no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-view-5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned a month in advance to the most minute detail, in order to waste as little time as possible searching for information on my phone while I was there. Plane and train tickets were bought, hotel and equipment rentals were reserved. I poured over maps of the Zermatt village, scoped out restaurants to eat at, and made sure I knew the routes around the slopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;itinerary&quot;&gt;Itinerary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday 19:00 - 21:30:&lt;/strong&gt; Flight from Luxembourg City to Geneva with a transfer at Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s possible to get to Zermatt from Geneva or Zurich, but the flight to Geneva was cheaper by about 50%, despite transferring at Zurich.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are direct flights, but they are much more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday 21:30 - 22:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Take the IR SBB train at the airport to Gare de Cornavin, the main train station in Geneva, and walk to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityhostel.ch/site/en/&quot;&gt;City Hostel Geneva&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I would have preferred to take a train straight from the airport to Zermatt upon landing in Geneva, instead of staying the night at a hostel. However the last train going to Zermatt was at 19:50. I couldn’t leave work early enough to take an early enough flight to get to Geneva before 19:50.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geneva.info/transport/free-ticket/&quot;&gt;free 80 minute transfer for Geneva’s public transit and SBB trains&lt;/a&gt; right before you exit the baggage area at the airport.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no security to get onto the train, but after the train is moving, there will be a ticket officer who will walk down the train cabins and check everyone’s ticket with a scanner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At Gare de Cornavin, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.migros.ch/fr/cooperatives/migros-geneve.html&quot;&gt;Migros&lt;/a&gt; grocery store where you can purchase food for meals or the lengthy train ride to Zermatt. Items of note include a variety of Swiss cheeses, baked goods, sandwiches, and famous Swiss chocolates like Lindt, Frey, and Minor. You can’t go wrong with the the store bought chocolates - they are as delicious as artisanal chocolates in North America.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday 22:00 - Saturday 04:30:&lt;/strong&gt; Stay overnight at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityhostel.ch/site/en/&quot;&gt;City Hostel Geneva&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g188057-d237550-Reviews-City_Hostel_Geneva-Geneva.html&quot;&gt;TripAdvisor&lt;/a&gt; review is 4/5 and it’s ranked 2 out of 10 in specialty lodging in Geneva.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The check in times are from 14:00 on the arrival day to midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check in was smooth, remember to bring your passport! Rooms are pretty small, but clean. There are lockers in the rooms that you can use, if you bring your own lock. The lockers fit a 45L backpack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday 04:30 - 09:30:&lt;/strong&gt; Take the earliest possible train to Zermatt, with a transfer at Visp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buy a train ticket &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets-for-switzerland/supersaver-tickets.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time. Buying early online is about 50 CHF, whereas if you buy at the train station, it’s about 100 CHF. If you buy online, the train ticket is non-refundable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no security to get onto the train, but after the train is moving, there will be a ticket officer who will walk down the train cabins and check everyone’s ticket with a scanner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will have about 20 minutes to transfer to another train at Visp. That gives you enough time to run to the Migros right outside the train station to pick up some more snacks and coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding the right platform is extremely easy at all the train stations. The platform numbers are everywhere on signs at the station and the station is generally a straight path with platforms on the left and right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday 09:30 - 10:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Walk to the hotel and check in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The train station is at the northern edge of the village.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotelsimi.ch/en/&quot;&gt;Hotel Simi&lt;/a&gt;, which was a 10 minute walk from the train station. It has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g188098-d229951-Reviews-Hotel_Simi_Zermatt-Zermatt_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html&quot;&gt;TripAdvisor&lt;/a&gt; rating of 4/5.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My rate was about $90 a night, which I got via my Chase Ultimate Rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The hotel room is modern and spacious with great views of the Matterhorn. The free breakfast buffet is delicious - it comes with a variety of cold cuts, cheeses, bread, fruits, yogurts, cereal, oatmeal, and juices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The hotel also has free luggage and ski/snowboard equipment storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday 10:00 - 11:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Rent equipment at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dorsaz-sport.ch/en/home.html&quot;&gt;Dorsaz Sport&lt;/a&gt; and purchase lift tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I chose Dorsaz Sport because it’s right next to the Matterhorn Express lift (which takes you up to the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise), and it also rents jackets and pants. I was travelling light for work and didn’t think it was worth it to pack my bulky snowboarding jacket and pants, so I had to rent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dorsaz Sport also provides free storage space, overnight included, that comes with the rental.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because I am only snowboarding for 2 days, I didn’t find any special deals for lift tickets online.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I chose to purchase a Zermatt only lift ticket for Saturday and a Zermatt-Cervinia lift ticket for Sunday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday 11:00 - 16:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Snowboard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-me.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are 3 main lifts at Zermatt: Matterhorn Glacier Paradise - Schwarzsee, Sunnegga - Rothorn, and Gornergrat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I chose to only go on the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise because:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I only had 2 days, and the first day is a shorter because I couldn’t get to Zermatt early enough via the train.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Matterhorn Glacier Paradise takes you to the highest point in Zermatt, the Klein Matterhorn, at 3883 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Matterhorn Glacier Paradise lets you board down to the Italian alpine resort of Breuil-Cervinia in Italy.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dorsaz Sport was located conveniently next to the Matterhorn Express, which is the gondola that takes you up to the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I spent Saturday familiarizing myself with the pistes, and spent Sunday making my over to the Breuil-Cervinia and then back to Zermatt. I wanted to make sure I had a whole day for this so that I don’t accidentally get stuck in Italy after the lifts are closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday 16:00 - end of day:&lt;/strong&gt; Explore the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-village-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-village-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-village-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-village-5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-village-6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-village-8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-village-9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I stored my equipment at Dorsaz Sport and walked back to the hotel to freshen up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g188098-d1015784-Reviews-Elsie_s_Bar-Zermatt_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html&quot;&gt;Elsie’s Bar&lt;/a&gt;. I had a plate of 3 oysters, a steak, and a Swiss bear, for 75 CHF. The steak was served with a raclette instead of the mashed potatoes that we get in North America. The food is pricey but delicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-view-9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-view-8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-view-7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After dinner, Zermatt has a lot of interesting stores to offer. There is a Coop in front of the train station, high end Swiss chocolate at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/l%C3%A4derach-chocolatier-suisse-zermatt&quot;&gt;Laderach&lt;/a&gt;, and several clothing stores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday 08:30 - 16:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Cervinia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/cervinia-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/cervinia-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I got into the lift at 08:30 right when it opens, with the goal of making my way to Cervinia in Italy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to get to Cervinia (use the free map they provide - it’s immensely useful):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take the Matterhorn Express up to Trockener Steg. The gondola makes stops at Furi, Schwarzsee, and Furgg, but you can just stay on.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At Trockener Steg, walk towards the tunnel to the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise cable car.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise cable car to the Klein Matterhorn, the highest point you can reach at Zermatt.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Follow the signs and ski/board to Testa Grigia (Plateau Rosa).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From Testa Grigia, there are two ways to get to the Italian village:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Go down the Ventina route #7 for a challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Or go down the Plan Maison route #6 and stop for lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g187864-d2702719-Reviews-Chalet_etoile-Breuil_Cervinia_Valle_d_Aosta.html&quot;&gt;Chalet Etoile&lt;/a&gt;.
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;It’s the #1 restaurant on TripAdvisor in Cervinia.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;The view on the terrace is absolutely unreal.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;The restaurant section with service has long wait times, reservations are recommended, and the food is more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Alternatively, you can also order your food at the cashier for much cheaper, and then take your food outside to the terrace and enjoy the grandiose view of the alps while you eat.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;The pasta is amazing - no matter what you order, you can’t go wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-lunch.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-lunch-terrace.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At Cervinia village, walk over to the Plan Maison gondola and take that up to Testa Grigia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From Testa Grigia, you can make your way back to Zermatt on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/weekend-snowboarding-at-zermatt/zermatt-jesus.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday 06:00 - Monday&lt;/strong&gt; Back to Geneva and Luxembourg City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I went back to the hotel to pick up my luggage, went to Migros to pick up dinner, and caught the 18:30 train back to Geneva, and back to City Hostel Geneva.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Monday morning at 06:00, I took the train to the Geneva airport and grabbed the 08:30 flight back to Luxembourg city with a transfer at Munich, just in time for work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  </author>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;This video is a conversation between Cenk Uygur and Sam Harris where they hash out their similarities and differences. More importantly, Harris is allowed to fully explain his view points. In other popular YouTube videos involving Sam Harris, such as the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60&quot; title=&quot;Bill Maher, Ben Afflect and Sam Harris debate&quot;&gt;Bill Maher, Ben Afflect and Sam Harris debate&lt;/a&gt;, his arguments tend to be interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/WVl3BJoEoAU&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 10 minutes of the conversation where Harris delivers his closing statements is particularly interesting. Harris portrays himself as a philosopher and states that much of his discussions have nothing to do with public policies but have been “an effort to get at ethical bedrock”. He explains that “in the context of having a philosophical discussion about [the] ethics and right and wrong”, seemingly crazy but legitimate arguments can surface. As an example, Harris poses a question: “What’s wrong with eating babies if there are extra babies?”. When quoted out of context, the question and the discussion surrounding the question is absurd. However, when trying to get to the bedrock about the ethics of good and evil, forming an ethical argument about why eating babies is wrong and why “intuitions of its wrongness can be conserved” is a legitimate conversation for philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever Harris is interviewed, his arguments regarding inflammatory issues such as nuclear deterrence, torture, and the link between belief and action, are made “in the context of a very extensive conversation in philosophical terms” about how to get to ethical bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the interview, Harris uses Osama bin Laden to demonstrate an ethical argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What makes it right to kill Osama bin Laden?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it right by virtue of all the people bin Laden has killed?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;No. We’re not certain Osama bin Laden personally killed anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it right by virtue of all the people that Al-Qaeda killed already?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;No. Killing Osama bin Laden does not bring anyone back to life, nor does it help anybody that is already killed, nor does it help the victims’ families.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Killing Osama bin Laden is the appropriate course of action if he could not be captured. The argument for killing him is not retribution, but is based on what bin Laden is aspiring to do in the future - all the people that are going to be saved if he is dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world of memes, sound bites and GIFs, not many people have been to a philosophical seminar. As a consequence, Harris pays a massive penalty for trying to have a fine-grained academic discussion because his words are being exported onto Twitter by public individuals like “Glenn Greenwald and Reza Aslan who do not [engage] with [his] arguments closely enough” and choose to “cynically mislead people” regarding Harris’ point of view. In closing, Harris admits that when arguing about the ethics of torture, the conversation is taking place in a world where there are individuals like Dick Cheney who are trying to justify a policy of rendition, and thus philosophical justifications can can be taken out of context and misconstrued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cenk Ugyur’s response to Harris’ closing statements is certainly true as well. Harris is not in a philosophical seminar, he is in the real world, people take his words seriously, and thus people will use his words with or without context for personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harris’ philosophical approach to these conversations explains his depth, but can also be seen as a weakness. When he goes on interviews like Bill Maher’s, Harris does not have the opportunity to hash out the details of his ideas because the panel interrupts him. On the following day, the media creates sound bites and misrepresents his views. However, the world needs people like Sam Harris to provide a solid definition of good and evil. Harris ventures back and forth between the philosophical world and the real world explaining the nuances of different situations, variables and spectrums. Without a concise understanding of good and evil, people will think with their guts based on thousand year old texts, which ultimately gets gay people killed and witches burned.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I listened to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://lewishowes.com/podcast/eric-thomas/&quot; title=&quot;Podcast Episode&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lewishowes.com/blog/&quot; title=&quot;The School of Greatness&quot;&gt;The School of Greatness&lt;/a&gt; where host Lewis Howes interviews Eric Thomas (ET The Hip Hop Preacher), the voice behind the motivational viral video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; title=&quot;How Bad Do You Want It?&quot;&gt;How Bad Do You Want It?&lt;/a&gt;, which is also epically known for the famous quotation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you will be successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Eric Thomas shares his rags to riches journey, and talks about the importance of determination and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion from listening to Eric Thomas is that he is a treasure trove of motivational quotations. When discussing work ethos, Eric Thomas, true to his title as The Hip Hop Preacher, preaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I got average skill, but I have phenomenal will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make up for our mediocrity with willpower, he further explains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I just had to buckle down and really ask myself, what do I really want to do with the rest of my life?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving home his point of the potential of hard work, Eric Thomas tells Lewis Howes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I realize that all of us are born with a gift, but you have to hone it… I realize that the gift is not going to create itself, it’s not going to nurture itself, it’s not going to perfect itself. That is something I have to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the interview, Eric Thomas talks about the videos that went and ultimately propelled him into fame. The video, he says, was “an accident.” The video happened because Eric was “in a room going off on a group of students” because the students “had the opportunity of a lifetime and they weren’t taking advantage of it.” Eric casually puts it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Some guy just happened to have a video camera, just happened to put the mic on me, just happened to use it for his thesis… He never used it for his thesis. Friend of mine put the video up on YouTube, not for the world, but for a place to house content. The video was online for years, and 2 to 3 months after I left my job, the video went viral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hip Hop Preacher argues: “that’s greatness”. For him, greatness is being able to “grind for grinding’s sake because you’re passionate about what you do”. He did not sit around for 2 years waiting for the video to go viral. Instead, Eric Thomas buckled down and grinded. Eric Thomas preaches passionately about executing everyday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[I’m] waking up every day with this concept [that] I have 24 hours and they are mine. This 24 hours belongs to me. And whatever I do in this 24 hours will determine where I’ll be tomorrow and the next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In that 24 hours, I can either break my life, or make my life. What should be on the priority list is going to bed so that [I] can wake up the next day and [I] can grind it out. I’m just a dude that believes that you reap what you sow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So if you’re grinding on Monday, grinding on Tuesday, grinding on Wednesday, if you’re grinding 6, 7 days a week for a span of 5 or 6 years, something has got to come out of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He concludes, that people should spend more time on figuring out what is needed to be done to “accomplish in this day to live this lifestyle”, and then more people will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this image today, it was taken on July 24th 1963, in the White House Rose Garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton had pushed and muscled his way to the front in order to meet the president. Immediately after this famous frame is another scene where Clinton is looking at his hand with this amazed look on his face. It was as if he will never again wash the hand that shook Kennedy’s hand. Following the handshake, Clinton turned around and said to his classmates that someday, he was going to have president Kennedy’s job, that someday, he was going to be the president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bill-clinton.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bill Clinton&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton has confidence in his gaze. He isn’t intimidated by the position of then president Kennedy, because he sees himself as worthy of that position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that in four months, the man on the right would be dead and in 30 years, the man on the left would be the 42nd president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two images speak volumes about being determined and studious to reach your goals, no matter how high and lofty they are.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;After going through two Reddit threads about Katy Perry’s singing abilities &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1t3h1m/katy_perry_gets_caught_lip_syncing_and_is_asked/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1t44sj/katy_perry_should_sing_like_this_more_often/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I have compiled a list of videos that demonstrate various female pop artists’ live singing capabilities, including Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and P!nk. I feel that Lady Gaga and P!nk are the strongest in terms of their abilitiy to sing and perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;katy-perry&quot;&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be offended that she did a different rendition of the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM&quot; title=&quot;Queen - Don&#39;t Stop me Now&quot;&gt;“Don’t Stop Me Now”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/GmJHS0dNFD0&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She seems to sing much better when not performing dance moves on stage. Katy Perry’s singing in live performances are not as impressive as studio recordings - she often sounds out of breath and a bit off key. Even though her singing might not be perfect, I like the live performances with the theatrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/JQU-nS5kP08&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lady-gaga&quot;&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are actually many videos on YouTube that show Lady Gaga performing live without any of the theatricals that she is known for. This is just one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/FtOF5wBPDsw&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;miley-cyrus&quot;&gt;Miley Cyrus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This performance probably has a lot of production and sound engineering incoorporated into it. However, it is nice to see her sing like this sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/wOwblaKmyVw&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pnk&quot;&gt;P!nk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P!nk and Nate Ruess have an incredible vocal range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/eSeh009_V1I&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really good performance. She executes some acrobatics while singing. The acrobatic actions include hanging off the ceiling and spinning around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/3stsDXki__U&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/success-kid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Success Kid&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be successful, I try to convince myself that working harder than everyone else is much more important than being born talented and smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k74r1aoMc0&quot;&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt; believes that he isn’t particularly talented and that his successes are achieved through his “ridiculous [and] sickening work ethic”. Even though “greatness exists in all of us”, not everyone achieves greatness because the “separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts”. He explains that everyone can be skilled, and a skill “is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on [the] craft” - Malcolm Gladwell anyone? For Will Smith, when others are sleeping, he’s working. When others are eating, he’s working. He “dedicates [himself] to being better every single day”. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH0nP4NzS9M&quot;&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; also maintains the similar belief that hard work is important to success. He says that “when you’re out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same time is working hard, someone is getting smarter and someone is winning”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the path to success is taken one step at a time. Will Smith argues that the first goal isn’t to “build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that has ever been built”. Instead, you must first lay a brick, and lay it “as perfectly as a brick can be laid”, and you lay that perfect brick every single day until you have a wall. The underlying advice here is to not set your goals so lofty that it seems daunting and impossible, and that you should not try to take shortcuts. However, each step on the path to success must be taken with hard work and complete dedication - there is no shortcut to working hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does hard work consist of? For &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtaxU6DZvLs&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, it means “work[ing] like hell” and putting in 80 to 100 hours a week. He has done it for years and it certainly “improves the odds of success”. Working at 80 hours a week, you will be able to complete twice as much as the average person and get to your goal twice as fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if a person is ambitious enough, by all means, aim for the top, but be wary of the effort that is required. The challenge here, according to Elon Musk, is to identify “the difference between really believing in your ideals and sticking to them as opposed to pursuing some unrealistic dream that doesn’t actually have merit”. Thus, it’s important to be “very rigorous in your self analysis”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you must also be passionate and really enjoy what you do, no matter the field. If you like what you’re doing, you will “think about it even when you’re not working”, your mind will be drawn to it. If the goal doesn’t hold much meaning, then it’s unlikely you can make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Hering, Kevin Mahaffey, and James Burgess, the founders of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lookout.com/&quot; title=&quot;Lookout&quot;&gt;Lookout&lt;/a&gt;, founded Lookout partly because they are passionate about security. I believe a main reason for Lookout’s success is because they want to solve hard problems and are not afraid to tackle them. I was told that to build a successful business, you cannot be afraid of trying to solve difficult problems. It is unlikely for someone to build the next Candy Crush Saga or Angry Birds with minimal innovations and rake in millions of dollars. King, the company that built Candy Crush Saga, published numerous games before they hit the jackpot. There are no shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, achieving success involves working hard on something that you are passionate about, dedicating your mind to that goal, and to not be scared away by difficult problems that arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that most importantly, I have to be passionate about what I am building and what I want to achieve. Having passion is a great motivator for putting in 80 hours a week into a task. Having passion means that you will want to solve the tough problems that come up, because solving them gets you one step closer to the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caveat of taking advice from these immensely successful individuals is that in addition to their amazing work ethic, all of them are undoubtedly smart and talented. Will Smith was admitted to a pre-engineering program at MIT and his ability to act can be seen throughout all his shows and movies. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a successful business man, bodybuilder, actor, and was also the governor of California. Elon Musk builds electric cars and is going to send mankind to Mars. You have to wonder how much of their successes is due to their talent and innate ability to pursue greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I believe and I hope that anyone can achieve greatness by emulating these great men.&lt;/p&gt;
