I listened to an [episode](http://lewishowes.com/podcast/eric-thomas/ "Podcast Episode") of [The School of Greatness](http://lewishowes.com/blog/ "The School of Greatness") where host Lewis Howes interviews Eric Thomas (ET The Hip Hop Preacher), the voice behind the motivational viral video, [How Bad Do You Want It?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ&feature=youtu.be "How Bad Do You Want It?"), which is also epically known for the famous quotation:

> "When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you will be successful."

In the interview, Eric Thomas shares his rags to riches journey, and talks about the importance of determination and hard work.

My conclusion from listening to Eric Thomas is that he is a treasure trove of motivational quotations. When discussing work ethos, Eric Thomas, true to his title as The Hip Hop Preacher, preaches:

> "I got average skill, but I have phenomenal will." 

To make up for our mediocrity with willpower, he further explains:

> "I just had to buckle down and really ask myself, what do I really want to do with the rest of my life?"

Driving home his point of the potential of hard work, Eric Thomas tells Lewis Howes:

> "I realize that all of us are born with a gift, but you have to hone it... I realize that the gift is not going to create itself, it's not going to nurture itself, it's not going to perfect itself. That is something I have to do."

In the beginning of the interview, Eric Thomas talks about the videos that went and ultimately propelled him into fame. The video, he says, was "an accident." The video happened because Eric was "in a room going off on a group of students" because the students "had the opportunity of a lifetime and they weren't taking advantage of it." Eric casually puts it:

> "Some guy just happened to have a video camera, just happened to put the mic on me, just happened to use it for his thesis... He never used it for his thesis. Friend of mine put the video up on YouTube, not for the world, but for a place to house content. The video was online for years, and 2 to 3 months after I left my job, the video went viral."

The Hip Hop Preacher argues: "that's greatness". For him, greatness is being able to "grind for grinding's sake because you're passionate about what you do". He did not sit around for 2 years waiting for the video to go viral. Instead, Eric Thomas buckled down and grinded. Eric Thomas preaches passionately about executing everyday:

> "[I'm] waking up every day with this concept [that] I have 24 hours and they are mine. This 24 hours belongs to me. And whatever I do in this 24 hours will determine where I'll be tomorrow and the next."

> "In that 24 hours, I can either break my life, or make my life. What should be on the priority list is going to bed so that [I] can wake up the next day and [I] can grind it out. I’m just a dude that believes that you reap what you sow."

> "So if you’re grinding on Monday, grinding on Tuesday, grinding on Wednesday, if you’re grinding 6, 7 days a week for a span of 5 or 6 years, something has got to come out of that."

He concludes, that people should spend more time on figuring out what is needed to be done to "accomplish in this day to live this lifestyle", and then more people will be successful.
