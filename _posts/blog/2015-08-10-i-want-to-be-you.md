I came across this image today, it was taken on July 24th 1963, in the White House Rose Garden.

Clinton had pushed and muscled his way to the front in order to meet the president. Immediately after this famous frame is another scene where Clinton is looking at his hand with this amazed look on his face. It was as if he will never again wash the hand that shook Kennedy's hand. Following the handshake, Clinton turned around and said to his classmates that someday, he was going to have president Kennedy's job, that someday, he was going to be the president of the United States.

Bill Clinton has confidence in his gaze. He isn't intimidated by the position of then president Kennedy, because he sees himself as worthy of that position.

Who would have thought that in four months, the man on the right would be dead and in 30 years, the man on the left would be the 42nd president of the United States.

These two images speak volumes about being determined and studious to reach your goals, no matter how high and lofty they are.
