This just sounds like an issue with the complexity of international adoption. Reading [https://globalnews.ca/news/4788056/abbotsford-couple-african-adoption-stalls/](https://globalnews.ca/news/4788056/abbotsford-couple-african-adoption-stalls/) and [https://bc.ctvnews.ca/our-worst-nightmare-fraser-valley-family-separated-as-government-questions-adoption-1.4228638](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/our-worst-nightmare-fraser-valley-family-separated-as-government-questions-adoption-1.4228638):

- the government gave the family 60 days to provide documents supporting the adoption
- need evidence to show that efforts were made to find the child's biological parents
- no police report describing the child's abandonment was filed with Immigration Canada
- the child was moved quickly away from the area he was found, a common tactic with human traffickers
- Nigerian officials have raised concerns about Kim's health status, as she has MS but Nigerian law requires both adoptive parents to be healthy
- immigration is looking into unverified third-party allegation that the child was taken from a home, not an orphanage
- under ideal circumstances, adoption and immigration can take between 6 to 8 months, and as long as 2 years, depending on the child's country of origin and other factors

The Morans are hitting the 2 year mark now. The case sounds complicated and the government moves slowly, so it seems like the Morans were too optimistic on the timeline.
