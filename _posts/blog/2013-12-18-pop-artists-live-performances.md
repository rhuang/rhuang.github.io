After going through two Reddit threads about Katy Perry's singing abilities [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1t3h1m/katy_perry_gets_caught_lip_syncing_and_is_asked/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1t44sj/katy_perry_should_sing_like_this_more_often/), I have compiled a list of videos that demonstrate various female pop artists' live singing capabilities, including Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and P!nk. I feel that Lady Gaga and P!nk are the strongest in terms of their abilitiy to sing and perform.

## Katy Perry

Don't be offended that she did a different rendition of the original ["Don't Stop Me Now"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM "Queen - Don't Stop me Now").

She seems to sing much better when not performing dance moves on stage. Katy Perry's singing in live performances are not as impressive as studio recordings - she often sounds out of breath and a bit off key. Even though her singing might not be perfect, I like the live performances with the theatrics.

## Lady Gaga

There are actually many videos on YouTube that show Lady Gaga performing live without any of the theatricals that she is known for. This is just one of them.

## Miley Cyrus

This performance probably has a lot of production and sound engineering incoorporated into it. However, it is nice to see her sing like this sometimes.

## P!nk

P!nk and Nate Ruess have an incredible vocal range.

This is a really good performance. She executes some acrobatics while singing. The acrobatic actions include hanging off the ceiling and spinning around.
